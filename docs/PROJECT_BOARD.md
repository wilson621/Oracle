**Branch:** `sprint-9-overlay`
**Implementation baseline before Sprint 13 closure:** `fa36af4`

# Current Sprint

## Sprint 13 — End-to-End Game Integration Vertical Slice

**Status:** Complete — implementation and closure verification passed

Sprint 13 proved Oracle's end-to-end Game Integration architecture using Call
of Duty as the first production integration, not as a special-case feature.

# Sprint 13 Commit Sequence

- [x] Commit 1 — deterministic Game Detection contracts (`01ddbd5`)
- [x] Commit 2 — immutable game Session Context (`3898d45`)
- [x] Commit 3 — Companion lifecycle integration (`5a25ee7`)
- [x] Commit 4 — renderer-safe Companion presentation (`fa36af4`)
- [x] Commit 5 — verification, documentation and Sprint closure

# Completed Sprint 13 Milestones

- [x] supported Call of Duty windows are detected externally
- [x] deterministic not-detected, detected and ambiguous outcomes
- [x] authoritative, immutable game-agnostic Session Context
- [x] serialized attach, detach, reattach and process replacement
- [x] active-game presentation through a restricted additive preload bridge
- [x] detector and coordinator failure isolation
- [x] Desktop Platform API version 1 preserved unchanged
- [x] Constitution and ADR formalise the External Companion boundary
- [x] complete web, desktop, lint, architecture and focused verification

# Completed Sprint 12.1 Milestones

- [x] Companion Session Manager
- [x] Companion Context Ownership
- [x] Desktop Host Snapshot
- [x] Snapshot Coordinator
- [x] Desktop Host Event Stream
- [x] Desktop Diagnostics
- [x] Desktop Recovery
- [x] Desktop Timeline
- [x] Desktop Telemetry
- [x] Documentation implementation audit
- [x] Canonical `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- [x] Permanent `PROJECT_VISION.md`
- [x] Commit 3 — Complete Session Lifecycle
- [x] Commit 4 — Desktop Platform API Freeze
- [x] Commit 5 — Dependency Boundary Audit
- [x] Commit 6 — Final Hardening and Sprint Closure

Commit 3 synchronises attachment changes with the authoritative Companion
Session lifecycle and guarantees cleanup when the renderer fails to load.

# Sprint 12 Commit Sequence

- [x] Commit 1
- [x] Commit 2
- [x] Commit 3 — Complete Session Lifecycle
- [x] Commit 4 — Desktop Platform API Freeze
- [x] Commit 5 — Dependency Boundary Audit
- [x] Commit 6 — Final Hardening and Sprint Closure

# Sprint 13 Closure

- [x] focused game-detection verification
- [x] focused Session Context verification
- [x] focused Companion lifecycle verification
- [x] focused presentation and preload verification
- [x] desktop TypeScript compilation and emitted Electron entry validation
- [x] Next.js production build and ESLint
- [x] architecture audit, native-helper path and repository validation
- [x] Sprint closure and release decision

No Sprint 13 engineering objective remains open. AI coaching, vision, OCR,
match analysis, dynamic guidance, recommendations, statistics and gameplay
automation were explicitly excluded. The release decision is to close the
verified sprint on `sprint-9-overlay` without creating a product release tag;
tagging remains part of a separately authorised release workflow.

# Verified Platform State

## Intelligence Runtime

- Oracle Context, Pipeline and Intelligence Bus implemented
- Engine Registry and Engine Runtime implemented
- Signals, Decisions, Explainability, Timeline and Intelligence State
  implemented
- production Intelligence page calls the Pipeline directly

## Platform Coordination

- Platform Runtime and bootstrap function implemented
- ten Service definitions registered by Platform Runtime
- six Application definitions registered by Platform Runtime
- Extension Runtime and Capability Graph implemented
- production startup does not currently invoke Platform bootstrap

## Desktop Platform

- Electron host and restricted preload bridge implemented
- deterministic discovery, target scoring and attachment implemented
- native Windows discovery and observation implemented
- versioned immutable desktop contracts implemented
- Diagnostics, Recovery, Timeline and Telemetry implemented
- Desktop Platform API version 1 is frozen through the sole supported external
  import surface at `desktop/platform/index.ts`

## Companion

- Platform-level Companion Runtime foundation implemented
- desktop Companion Session and Context ownership implemented
- attachment and detachment transitions are reflected in the active desktop
  Companion Session
- supported-game discovery, attachment and process replacement are serialized
- game context is installed from the exact selected integration and cleared on
  detach, process loss and shutdown
- renderer presentation is a validated, game-agnostic projection of the
  authoritative Session
- renderer load failure closes the desktop controller and ends the started
  Session
- the two lifecycle layers are not yet connected by an explicit contract
- Electron currently loads `/oracle`; registered `/companion` route is absent

## Game Integrations

- Game Integration contract, registry and evaluator implemented
- Call of Duty integration and executable profile implemented
- production registry is invoked by the game-agnostic desktop coordinator
- deterministic detection drives the desktop Companion lifecycle
- Call of Duty-specific executable and title knowledge remains isolated inside
  its Game Integration

# Architecture Audit

Target ownership remains:

```text
Oracle Platform
        ↓
Oracle Services
        ↓
Oracle Applications
        ↓
Game Integrations
```

Open findings:

1. some web Applications directly import repositories, pipelines and engines
2. Platform bootstrap is not a production entry-point dependency
3. registered Services and Applications are metadata foundations, not the
   exclusive runtime boundary

These findings are measured legacy exceptions retained from Sprint 12.1. They
remain accepted technical debt and do not authorise unrelated redesign.

# Documentation Health

- [x] Constitution updated with the permanent External Companion rule
- [x] Codex reviewed; normative standards remain authoritative
- [x] Oracle Principles reviewed; no change required
- [x] Architecture aligned to verified implementation
- [x] Companion Architecture aligned to verified implementation
- [x] Roadmap distinguishes projection from delivered work
- [x] Master Build Plan reflects Sprint 12.1
- [x] ADRs record desktop snapshot/event and Timeline/Telemetry ownership
- [x] ADR records the Desktop Platform API version 1 compatibility commitment
- [x] Sprint 12.1 implementation audit added
- [x] Sprint 12.1 retrospective added
- [x] Sprint 13 implementation and closure record added
- [x] Constitution defines the permanent External Companion rule
- [x] ADR-031 records its rationale, alternatives and implications

# Closure Rule

Sprint 13 closure verification passed on 21 July 2026. Focused detection,
Session Context, lifecycle and presentation/preload checks passed, as did the
architecture audit, desktop TypeScript compilation, production build, emitted
Electron entry and native-helper path validation, lint and repository checks.
The five existing lint warnings remain documented, unrelated technical debt.
